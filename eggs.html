                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself<br>
                        <em>are you ready?</em></li>
                    <li>Heat your pan on medium heat and while it is heating, Begin to prep your ingredients</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl</li>
                            <li>Whisk until it feels like a massive bowl of yellow nut</li>
                            <li>Resist the urge to just chug the whole bowl</li>
                            <li>Slowly add milk while whisking a medium pace until<br>
                                the color of the eggs has lightenened to a rich yellow</li>
                            <li>Here you can add diced bell peppers, tomatoes, etc</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>spray some non-stick on the pan, <em>ideally, it shouldn't burn<br>
                        when it touches the pan, but don't worry if it does</em></li>
                    <li>Add egg mixture and begin wait til you see a lighter color form around the brim of the pan</li>
                    <li>Once a consistent ring of lighter yellow has formed around the pan<br>
                        use the spatula to drag the edges of the pan towards the middle</li>
                    <li>Continue to do this and pay attention to how the eggs cook</li>
                    <li>Every 30 seconds, raise the pan off of the heat for 5 seconds as you <br>
                        continue to drag the cooked edges towards the middle</li>
                    <li>While you are doing this, ask yourself why doesn't your father love you</li>
                    <li>As soon as the eggs are fully solidified and there isn't any pure liquid left <br>
                        in the pan, remove the pan from heat and transfer to a plate. <em>This ensures you<br>
                        don't overcook the eggs. You want them to retain a soft texture with some shine to it.<br>
                        You never want to overcook the eggs until they are a rubbery texture. Remove from heat <br>
                        when you see there is no liquid left, but the eggs are just barely like a clumpy, gel texture.</em></li>
                    <li>Add garnish and consume with the rest of your beautiful breakfast.</li>
